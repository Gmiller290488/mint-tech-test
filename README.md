To run locally:

If you are running on a linux machine, clone the repo and then you can set up a simple http server with:
``` python -m SimpleHTTPServer ```
from the directory you cloned the repo to.
If you then use the address `http://127.198.0.0:8000/` in your browser you will be able to see the webapp.


If running on a Windows machine, download the zip of the repo, and extract all the files to the same directory. 
Then right-click on the `index.html` file and select `open with ` and select your browser of choice.
